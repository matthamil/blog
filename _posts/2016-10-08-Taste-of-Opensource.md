title: Taste of Open-source
---

I was scrolling through Twitter the other day and saw a post about an event going on called "Hacktoberfest." [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) rewards Github users who contribute to open-source projects during the month of October. The thought of making a contribution to an open-source project as a new developer sounded daunting, if not impossible.

I had always heard and read online that employers like it when interviewees talk about their open-source contributions. How is a new developer supposed to make a significant impact when their own code is horrid? I wanted to give it a try. Surely I could find _some_ project that I could impact.

I signed up for Hacktoberfest, and I lurked through the issue board. There were thousands of open issues on Github ranging from easy tasks like writing a README file to harder ones such as rewriting an entire application using a different framework.

I found one an issue that I thought I could help with.

> I need a script to be able to download and install everything in this repo from the command line.

I can do that, I thought. I opened a text editor and wrote a Bash script. I forked the repo, added the script, and opened a pull request. I thought that my contribution didn't entirely solve the user's problem. I thought my script wasn't good enough. It's not slick like other scripts I've seen. It doesn't pop up cool ASCII art in your terminal like other install scripts. I doubted my efforts. Surely someone else will come along and write a shorter script that has more thought put into it. I doubted my own abilities.

I got a Github notification.

> Merged #16.

I checked the original repo. The issue was closed. I made a contribution to an open-source project.

One out of four contributions for Hacktoberfest accomplished.

It was a crazy feeling. Some code that I had written is now in a complete stranger's project. I wondered how it felt being on the other end of an open-source contribution. I went through an old project of mine and noticed that it didn't have a completed README. I opened an issue, tagged it with the "Hacktoberfest" tag. Within an hour and a half, I had a completed PR from someone in another country.

> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, posted an issue with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hacktoberfest?src=hash">#Hacktoberfest</a> tag, and less than two hours later I have a PR from a complete stranger. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash">#opensource</a></p>&mdash; Matt Hamil (@_matthamil) <a href="https://twitter.com/_matthamil/status/783510881518968833">October 5, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The next day, I woke up to another PR submitted from the same person adding a feature that I wasn't even mentioned in the original issue.

The power of open-source is amazing.

I convinced a few other friends at Nashville Software School to join me this Hacktoberfest. After showing them how easy it was to find an easy-to-solve issue in the list, I keep seeing notifications in my feed of my friends forking repositories to make contributions.

Hacktoberfest is great. It is a great way to introduce people to the world of open-source. It's extremely easy for new developers to get onboard.

I'd like to say thanks to Github and DigitalOcean for sponsoring this event. Without it, I don't know when I would have started contributing to open-source projects.

If you haven't signed up for Hacktoberfest, check out the [official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Once you start making contributions to someone else's code base, it's hard to stop wanting to do the same for others.
